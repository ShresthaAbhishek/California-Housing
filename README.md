# 🏠 California Housing Price Prediction (Learning Project)

This project was created as a **learning exercise** to explore and understand the **fundamentals of machine learning**, particularly focusing on **data cleaning**, **visualization**, and **regression modeling**. It utilizes the **California Housing dataset** to predict median house values in different districts based on various socioeconomic aswell as geographic features.
